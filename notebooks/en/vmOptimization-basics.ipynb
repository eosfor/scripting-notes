    "Do you feel it is time to move your servers from on-prem DC to Azure cloud? One of the steps in this long journey is to map existing servers to their Azure counterparts. Along with that, we want to reduce the costs of the overall bundle of boxes. But at the same time, we need to get the highest performance possible. In theory, we can simply map the source VMs to the target VMs by the number of virtual CPUs and the amount of RAM. It is not the most difficult task in the world. However, in this case, we can't guarantee the highest possible performance for the lowest possible price. Suppose we always pick a VM with the lowest price, but in this case, we lose the performance. On the other hand, if we start picking VMs with the highest performance, we will also get the highest cost. Is there a middle ground? Is it even possible to get what we want? Let us see"
