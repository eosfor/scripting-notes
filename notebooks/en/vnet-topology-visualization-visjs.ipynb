We want to visualize the topology somehow, at any point in time. Additionally, we want to highlight VNETs, where VNET peering was not configured correctly, as we know that this kind of thing happens from time to time due to some bugs in automated procedures we have. In addition to this, we also know that there are a few devices connected to some networks. Someone complained that one of these devices does not work as expected, and we want to see where it is"

There is the `Label` property in this type, and it is a key property for comparison operations, search and visualization. Another property of interest is the `OriginalObject` property. It has a link to the origunal object, which was used to create the vertex. To initialize the `Label` property the `ToString()` method is being called on each object. In cas of `PSVirtualNetwork` this call returns the name of the type, but we need unique names as labels. To overcome this we have a constructor for the `PSGraph.Model.PSVertex` whch take as `Label` as `string` and the original object. This way we can override the labeling mechanism and provide our own labels."
